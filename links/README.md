# links-webpage-demo
A Linktree-type webpage that is built using HTML, JavaScript, and JSON.

## How it works:
The included JavaScript file looks at the JSON and creates a templated link element 

## What's included in each link?
By default, each link contains a possible CSS attribute for styling specific links, the link itself, and the link text. This can be modified to accompany whatever data makes sense to include.

## Note:
This implementation requires JavaScript to be allowed on the client's (end user's) machine. Because of this, it is recommended to include a `<noscript>` banner/text in case JavaScript is not turned on.
